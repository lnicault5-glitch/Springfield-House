          Springfield House as it appeared in Carlton Mitchell’s 1948 travel

      <p>
        In his 1948 travel book <em>Islands to Windward</em>, sailor and writer
        Carlton Mitchell described Springfield as a lively gathering place. At
        that time, the estate was a modest plantation house above the Roseau
        Valley, not yet transformed into the larger residence and guest
        facilities Archbold would later build.

      <p>
        Mitchell recalled sailors, travelers, and locals climbing the hill to
        Springfield to share in John’s hospitality. On Saturday evenings the
        estate filled with music:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          “The band assembled on the terrace after dinner. The melody was
          carried by a lone flutist, joined by drums stretched from wooden tubs,
          a triangle struck with a valve stem, guitars, a hollow bamboo
          ‘boom-boom,’ and a rattling tin shak-shak. The rhythm was irresistible
          — heads bobbed, hands clapped, and laughter carried into the night.”
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        This scene shows Springfield’s early role as a
        <strong>social and cultural crossroads</strong> — a place of music,
        fellowship, and welcome that laid the foundation for its later chapters
        in science and philanthropy.

      <h2>The Story of Springfield</h2>
      <p>
        The Springfield property has deep roots in Dominican history. Originally
        owned by the <strong>Bellot family</strong>, the land was later
        purchased in 1935 by
        <a href="{% url 'archbold' %}"><strong>John Dana Archbold</strong></a
        >, whose vision and philanthropy shaped much of its legacy. In the
        1940s, Archbold constructed <strong>Springfield House</strong>, now
        preserved as a museum.
      </p>

      <section class="history-bridge">
        <p>
          In the world that greeted Archbold, Dominica’s valleys were dense with
          fern and cocoa, the air alive with birdsong and the scent of rain.
          Writers like Rosita Forbes spoke of it as an “island in the sun,” a
          name that still feels true today.
        </p>
      </section>

      <p>
        Beside the main residence, Mr Archbold built the
        <strong>Springfield Guest House</strong>, which for many years served as
        one of Dominica’s most sought-after places to stay. Known for its
        <strong>classic atmosphere and old-world charm</strong>, the Guest House
        was a lively hub of community life, even hosting weddings and social
        gatherings. Following his passion for education and development, John
        Dana Archbold contributed to the creation of the
        <strong>Archbold Tropical Research and Education Center</strong>. The
        main house, however, remained private — until now.

      <p>
        Today, Springfield House is being carefully restored and opened to the
        public for the first time. Visitors can view the preserved rooms,
        antique furnishings, art collections, and the surrounding gardens, while
        also enjoying a dramatic viewpoint of the Caribbean Sea over what was
        once a banana and grapefruit plantation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, Springfield House and the Guest House are
        <strong>cultural landmarks</strong> whose preservation is in the
        national interest. They embody Dominica’s resilience, community spirit,
        and the intertwining of personal stories with the island’s wider
        history.
      </p>

      <h3>Furnishings with a Story</h3>
      <p>
        Mr Archbold brought and collected <strong>antique furniture</strong> —
        some imported, some commissioned, and many purchased from other estates.
        From <strong>South Chilton Estate</strong> (through figures such as
        <strong>Mr. Henderson</strong>) to acquisitions from
        <strong>Maggie Nicholls of Kingsland House</strong>, each piece carries
        a thread of Dominican history. As Kingsland House itself had belonged to
        <strong>Dr. John Imray (1811–1880)</strong>, a renowned Scottish
        scientist, some furniture may well trace its origins back to Europe,
        reflecting both local and international heritage.
      </p>

      <h3>The Art Collection</h3>
      <p>
        Perhaps the most remarkable treasure of Springfield House is its
        <strong>art collection</strong>. Alongside a few older prints, Archbold
        assembled numerous <strong>oil paintings</strong>, most created during
        the 1980s and 1990s by Dominican artists. Among them are early works by
        internationally acclaimed painter <strong>Earl Etienne</strong>, as well
        as pieces by Darius, Louison, K. Royer, and others. These works depict
        traditional life, community scenes, and the island’s landscapes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Together, these paintings form a vivid portrait of Dominica’s culture
        and memory, adding depth to the museum experience and confirming
        Springfield’s role as a guardian of national heritage.
      </p>

      <p>
        These collections make Springfield more than a home — they turn it into
        a <strong>living museum</strong>, where each object is part of a broader
        story of resilience, exchange, and cultural memory.
      </p>

      <h3>People of Springfield</h3>
      <p>
        The story of Springfield also belongs to its people.
        <strong>Cecilia</strong>, Archbold’s personal chef, cared for him in the
        last years of his life. <strong>Desmond Eusell</strong>, born on the
        property, still tends the grounds today with his sons.
        <strong>Mr. Bruno</strong>, once manager of Springfield, was able to
        purchase land in Sylvania and build a family home thanks to his work
        here. <strong>Mrs. Alexander</strong> celebrated her wedding at
        Springfield in 1998, continuing the tradition of the house as a place of
        family, community, and cherished memories.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their lives and celebrations are part of Springfield’s legacy of
        opportunity, resilience, and belonging — proof that the house is not
        only a historic landmark, but a living part of Dominican life.
